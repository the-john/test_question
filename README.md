A character in a platformer game is standing on a single row of floor tiles numbered 0 to N, at position X.
When the character moves, the tile at the previous position disappears.  The character can only move left and right, and always jumps over one tile, and any holes.  The character will not move if there are no tiles left to move to (you do not need to implement this in the code)l
Implement a class that models this behavior and can report the character's possition *efficiently* with respect to time used.
For example, Platformer(6, 3) creates a row of 6 tiles (numbered 0 to 5) and a character positioned on tile 3 {0 1 2 [3] 4 5}.  A subsequent call to jumpRight() moves the character two tiles to the right and the tile at position 1 disappears, skipping tiles that have disappeared{0 2 [4] 5}.  Calling position() method at this point should return 4.
